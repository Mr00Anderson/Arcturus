0.2 - Playground

    - multiple solar systems / hyperdrive
    - home system contains shipyard, friendly ships
    - pirate system contains hostile ships


    - assets needed
        - rocket/missile and launcher
        - smoke particle for missile trail

    - basic faction system
        - just a property for each ship for now, will eventually load from json, change, etc
        - ai determines target by player faction for now

    - solar save/load system
        - fix mapPane to load systemlist from SolarSystemManager
        - make hyperdrive jump key
        - test system change
        - elapsed time - modify SolarSystem and TerrainFactory to handle additional time parameter

    - newgame system
        - move everything out of GameScreen
        - fix playership/playerdata ship loading

    - hyperdrive
        - implemented in transitionManager
        - limited range based on power/ship mass
        - can only jump outside mass limit - hyberbola perpendicular to flight path, closest radius property of solarsystem
        - draw hyper limit in space/only on map? once course is selected

    - rockets/missiles
    - launchers
    - particle effects system
        - smoke trails

    - pd weapons
        - aiming ai
        - weapon fire groups

0.3 - Adventure

    - strategic AI
    - graphics improvements to beam, explosions on hit, etc
    - armour system / shields
    - detailed HUD, including minimap
    - animated engines
    - new inventory items - engines, armour, missiles, etc
    - add money to inventory system
    - error handling on json reads, file access, and factories

Menu
    - options menu
        - keybinds menu
    - call main menu while in another menu -> saving while in menus
    - create modified version of ScrollPane for mapPane - can then use for shipyard as well

Graphics
    - dynamic load animations in services (from json files) - finish EffectFactory
    - particle effects for missile trails, etc
    - 3d planets using modelbuilder.createsphere

Game
    - rockets/torpedoes
    - missiles
    - Shields
         - graphical assets
         - component
         - collision
         - damage
    
AI
    - assign actual target to AI.  right now it just defaults to entity 0 - default to PlayerShip?
    - Attack, Escort, Protect, Travel - AI type component
    - split proximity list into ships and projectiles - change avoidCollision to only dodge ships.  Allows for bullet dodging as a separate behaviour.
    - add caching to proximity(sensor range)
        -lists of friendly/hostile

World
    - solar system load/save mechanism - storage to POJO, which can then be manipulated by time passing thread.
    - change solar system mechanism - save playership data, clear artemis, load playership and new system

LONG TERM
    - Splash screen via java VM loader
    - custom cursor
    - add start icon for game

BUGS/Tweaks
    - sometimes ship position stutters if shiptype is othership. - Not observed since 0.1
    - on worldCam.reset(), just set camera position to target, don't set motion target.
    - NPE if map of shipyard is opened after playership is destroyed - look in transitionManager
    - add rotational speed limit for ships

ASSETS NEEDED
    WeaponSlot icons(valid/invalid)
    rocket/missile
    rocket/missile/ship engine flame animation
    more weapons
    more ships
