Menu
    - look into implementing a FSM for menu screens (StackStateMachine)
    - save/load menu
    - options menu

Graphics
    - dynamic load animations in services (from json files)

AI
    - more steering behaviours - evade, interpose, maintain distance
    - more tasks - patrol, flee, protect, escort, isStrife
    - split proximity list into ships and projectiles - change avoidCollision to only dodge ships.  Allows for bullet dodging as a separate behaviour.
    - gunnery
        - aiming iterates lists of weapons, sets/clears target data(includes calculating shot leading for now), returns true for that weapon when ready to fire

World
    - solar system load/save mechanism

LONG TERM
    - Splash screen via java VM loader
    - custom cursor
    - add start icon for game

BUGS/Tweaks
    - turret rotation speed is not independant of vessel rotation
