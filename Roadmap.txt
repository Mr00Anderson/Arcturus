Menu
    - look into implementing a FSM for menu screens (StackStateMachine)
    - save/load menu
    - options menu
    - in world pause to menu - use framebuffer capture for menu background - will need FSM based menu

Graphics
    - dynamic load animations in services (from json files)

Shields
    - graphical assets
    - component
    - collision
    - damage

AI
    - more steering behaviours - evade, flee, maintain distance
    - more tasks - patrol, flee, protect, escort, isStrife, isHurt
    - split proximity list into ships and projectiles - change avoidCollision to only dodge ships.  Allows for bullet dodging as a separate behaviour.

World
    - solar system load/save mechanism - from kryo if it exists, from json if not
    - change solar system mechanism - save playership data, clear artemis, load playership and new system

LONG TERM
    - Splash screen via java VM loader
    - custom cursor
    - add start icon for game

BUGS/Tweaks
    - turret rotation speed limited by ship rotation - change
