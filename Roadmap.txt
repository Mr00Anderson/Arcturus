    When do we want to allow saving/loading?  In space only, on stations?  Ideally both - should have a tag
        - in space save - use WorldSerializer only
        - while on station, freeze time for now, only extract playership.  can add time advancement to artemis world MUCH later
                - load on station - revert to main station menu page for now.  can save menustack later if we want to.

    Playership - weapons arrays

Menu
    - options menu
        - keybinds menu

Graphics
    - dynamic load animations in services (from json files)
    - particle effects for missile trails, etc

Shields
    - graphical assets
    - component
    - collision
    - damage

Game
    - rockets/torpedoes
    - missiles

Shipyard
    - menus
    - ship components
    - save/load system for custom loadouts - json saves
    
AI
    - Attack, Escort, Protect, Travel - AI type component
    - split proximity list into ships and projectiles - change avoidCollision to only dodge ships.  Allows for bullet dodging as a separate behaviour.
    - add caching to proximity(sensor range)
        -lists of friendly/hostile

World
    - solar system load/save mechanism - from kryo if it exists, from json if not
    - change solar system mechanism - save playership data, clear artemis, load playership and new system

LONG TERM
    - Splash screen via java VM loader
    - custom cursor
    - add start icon for game

BUGS/Tweaks
    - turret rotation speed limited by ship rotation - change
    - fade in/out should be limited to menu stage, not include background
