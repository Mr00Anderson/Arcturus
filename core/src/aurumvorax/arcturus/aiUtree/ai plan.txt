* are prioritized options

*Danger - hostiles close or taking damage
    Escape - odds of victory * cautiousness of captain * feasible(relative speeds)
        *Help - nearby allies?
        Away - get distance, try for goal direction
    Fight - odds of victory * cautiousness of captain
        *Pursuit - distance and relative speed
            - give chase, parting shot(missiles?) before they leave range
        Attack
            Circle
            Charge
        Fallback - energy low?
            - maintain distance and recharge(hysteresis)

            - maintain distance and fire
        Breakthrough - do we have a desired goal and odds of victory * captain aggressiveness
            - maintain course, defend self
    Defeat - odds of victory, can't escape
        Dump cargo - cargo value, enemy nature
        Full surrender - cargo value, enemy nature
        Suicide charge - enemy nature, self nature
    Victory - odds of victory, enemy slower
        Order surrender - self nature, potential reward

*Comms
    surrender offers/demands
    help offers/requests
Goals - nothing higher priority
    - work on goal queue

System - on ai tick, update data(sensors, health, etc) in blackboard, then run utree to set behaviours in blackboard
        - on regular tick, run behaviours in blackboard

        ie - ai tick detects threat, sets target, sets behaviour to approach with collision avoidance, fire when in range


****Odds of victory calculator

pick primary target
our offence - their defence vs their offence - their defence          weighted by relative range of primary weapons and relative manouverability
+ allies threat rating, scaled by distance(closing speed?)
+ enemies threat rating, scaled by distance(closing speed?)

(aSum(offence) + sum(defence)) * weapon range scalar * manouverability scalar
