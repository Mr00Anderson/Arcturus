System - on ai tick, update data(sensors, health, etc) in blackboard, then run utree to set behaviours in blackboard
        - on regular tick, run behaviours in blackboard

        ie - ai tick detects threat, sets target, sets behaviour to approach with collision avoidance, fire when in range

ShipAI is coordinator, scheduler and initializer
utree package contains all tree nodes
steering contains steering behaviours
gunnery contains all gunnery behaviours, tageting routines and threat assesment
